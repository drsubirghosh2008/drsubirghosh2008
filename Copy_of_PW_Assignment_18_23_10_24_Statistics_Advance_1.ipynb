        "1. Discrete Probability Distributions\n",
        "These distributions deal with discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of values. Some common discrete distributions include:\n",

        "Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., flipping a coin).\n",
        "\n",
        "Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate (e.g., the number of calls received at a call center per hour).\n",
        "\n",
        "Geometric Distribution: Models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",

        "Negative Binomial Distribution: Generalizes the geometric distribution to model the number of trials until a specified number of successes occurs.\n",

        "These distributions deal with continuous random variables, which can take any value within a given range. Some common continuous distributions include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Normal Distribution: A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution characterized by its mean and standard deviation. Many natural phenomena are normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely within a specified range (e.g., rolling a fair die).\n",
        "\n",
        "Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process, often used for survival analysis and reliability testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Log-Normal Distribution: A distribution of a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed, often used to model variables that are positively skewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gamma Distribution: A two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions, often used in queuing models and reliability analysis.\n",

Each distribution has specific characteristics and is used in different scenarios based on the nature of the data being analyzed.\n"
