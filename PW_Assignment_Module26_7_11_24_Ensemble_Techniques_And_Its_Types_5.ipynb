        "The accuracy printed at the end indicates the model's performance on the test set. The VotingClassifier often benefits from combining the strengths of both classifiers (e.g., Random Forest for non-linear relationships and Logistic Regression for interpretability). For further improvement, consider fine-tuning hyperparameters or adding additional classifiers to the ensemble."
