        "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components to prevent accidental interference or misuse.\n",
        "Example: In a class, we use private variables and methods to hide the internal details of the object from the outside world. The public methods are used to interact with the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It simplifies the interface for the user.\n",
        "Example: When you use a TV remote, you only interact with buttons (interface), without worrying about the internal circuits or processes happening inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a new class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, allowing the Dog class to reuse properties like age and methods like eat() from the Animal class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows one method to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "Example: A method called draw() can be implemented differently in multiple classes such as Circle, Rectangle, or Square. Even though the method name is the same, it will produce different outputs based on the object it is called on.\n",
        "These four pillars provide the foundation for designing modular, scalable, and maintainable code in OOP."

        "\n",
        "The __init__() function in Python is a special method, also known as the constructor. It is automatically invoked when a new object of a class is created. The primary purpose of __init__() is to initialize the object's attributes with values when the object is instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Initialization: It allows you to initialize the object's state by assigning initial values to the attributes.\n",
        "Automatic Call: It is automatically called when an object is created, and you don’t need to call it explicitly.\n",
        "Not a Destructor: It is used for initialization, not cleanup (destruction). For cleanup purposes, Python uses __del__().\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "__init__(): In the above example, the __init__() method is used to initialize the name and age attributes of the Person object when it is created.\n",
        "Object Creation: When person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25) is executed, the __init__() method is automatically called with \"Alice\" and 25 as arguments to initialize the name and age attributes of person1.\n",
        "Method Usage: The introduce() method can then use these initialized attributes for further actions or behaviors.\n",
        "Without the __init__() method, attributes would have to be manually assigned after creating an object, which can be inconvenient and error-prone.\n"
