        "Technique: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining important information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Application: Anomalies can be detected by projecting data into a lower-dimensional space and identifying points that are distant from the main cluster of normal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In high-dimensional datasets (like images), PCA can help visualize data in fewer dimensions, making it easier to spot outliers.\n",

        "e. Autoencoders\n",
        "\n",
        "Technique: Autoencoders are neural networks used for unsupervised learning. They learn to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Application: Anomalies can be detected based on the reconstruction error. If the error exceeds a certain threshold, the data point may be considered an anomaly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In fraud detection for credit card transactions, normal transaction patterns can be learned by an autoencoder, and transactions with high reconstruction errors can be flagged as suspicious.\n",

        "3. Applications of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection\n",
        "Unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection can be applied in various domains, including:\n",

        "Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning provides robust methods for anomaly detection, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. By leveraging techniques such as clustering, statistical methods, and neural networks, organizations can identify anomalies effectively, leading to timely interventions and improved decision-making."
