        "\n",
        "Definition: Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise or random fluctuations. This means the model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consequences: Overfitting leads to high accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test data, indicating poor generalization. The model is overly complex and too tightly fitted to the specifics of the training set.\n",

        "Simplify the model: Use fewer parameters or less complex algorithms.\n",
        "Regularization: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization penalize large coefficients in linear models, helping to reduce overfitting.\n",

        "Cross-validation: Helps to check how the model performs on unseen data during training.\n",

        "Regularization helps prevent overfitting by introducing penalties that control model complexity. Techniques like L1, L2, Elastic Net, Dropout, and Early Stopping adjust either the model's structure or training process to discourage overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data. Regularization strength, controlled by a parameter (e.g.,\n",
        "𝜆\n",
        "λ), should be carefully tuned to achieve the right balance."
