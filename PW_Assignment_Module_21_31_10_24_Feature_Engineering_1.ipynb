        "Data Augmentation\n",
        "Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of a training dataset by applying various transformations to existing data points. It is commonly used in fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and audio processing to improve the robustness and generalization of machine learning models. The goal is to create new, synthetic examples from existing data without collecting additional data, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to learn from diverse inputs.\n",
