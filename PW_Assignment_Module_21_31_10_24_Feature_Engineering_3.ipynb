        "Min-Max scaling is a normalization technique used in data preprocessing to transform features to a common scale, typically between 0 and 1. This scaling is particularly useful when the features have different units or ranges, as it helps to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data, such as gradient descent-based methods.\n",

        "Using Min-Max scaling as a preprocessing step in your food delivery recommendation system can enhance the performance of the model by standardizing the feature values, ensuring that all features contribute appropriately to the calculations involved in generating recommendations. This normalization process is essential in ensuring that the recommendation system functions effectively and provides accurate suggestions to users."

        "When building a model to predict stock prices, especially with a dataset that includes a variety of features such as company financial data (e.g., revenue, profit margins, debt levels) and market trends (e.g., trading volume, historical prices), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be a valuable tool for reducing dimensionality. By using PCA, you can simplify your model, mitigate overfitting, and potentially improve predictive performance.\n",

        "Elbow Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "Create a scree plot of the eigenvalues. Look for a point where the eigenvalues start to level off (the \"elbow\"). The number of components before this point is often a good choice.\n",
